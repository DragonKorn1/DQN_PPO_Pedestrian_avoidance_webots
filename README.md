# Code structure
The structure of the simulation code is classified in 3 main parts.
 - worlds: the worlds folder contains the simulation environment and controller file configurations to simulate the scenario.
 - controllers: the controller folder includes the Robot-Supervisor scheme coding to manipulate both the robot's and the supervisor's configuration and learning algorithms as well as the pedestrian robot control. These are seperated into 3 parts.
   - 4_wheel_supervisor: this folder contains the supervisor configurations and each algorithm code for the robot to learn the scenario.
   - mini_pedestrian: the folder involve the pedestrian control of the pedestrian robot in the scenario.
   - super_robot: this folder includes the robot's configuration file.
 - proto: this proto folder contains the physical configuration of the obstacle and pedestrian and also segmentation settings for the camera.
